            <span> Hello, I am currently based in Singapore and is working in Circles.Life as a Data Engineer. <br />
            I enjoy making things work and scalable. <br />
            Other then coding, I like all things science from Biochemistry to Mechnical Engineering...  <br />
            Self-help books and reading on new innovations are some of my favourites too. </span>

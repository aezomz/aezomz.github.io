I have been wondering for a long time personally. 

How do people manage to learn so many stuff? Is jack of all trades even good? 

&nbsp; &nbsp; _Being borned a curiosity child, I have always been wondering what is the most efficient strategy to pick up new skills? Be able to learn and adapt quickly?_ 

After lots of collective reads and wondering what works the best for me. I realized that compounding learning does amazing magic and don't underestimate the effectiveness of crash course.

Due to the demanding requirements from the industry, individual are expected do alot more than they are equipped. Even if its not for the industry but for yourself. 

Learning new skills or hobby can be quite challenging. 

Here are some steps I find highly effective.  

## 1  
Little by little - Keep in mind that all great things doesn't come instantly. Start small start now. 

Then. Ouch, why is everything so complex? Got beaten by brick.  
__Remember if its too complex, go one step lower, keep in mind that complexity is the combination of art. Art is made out of colors. Always breakdown to things that can be absorbed.__ 

## 2
Compounding effect - if you come from a finance background, great. Remember it doesn't apply to Maths only. It applies to everything.  

__Remember start small, don't burnout. No one is able to run a marathon overnight with a day training. Build it slowly. Remember that its a journey. The only way to bring yourself far is to focus on the PROCESS. Take a break, always take a break.  Taking a break is not being a loser. Quitting is.__ 

_Personally I suffer from this alot. Its very easy to be hyped and motivated and rush through. Eventually just to find out that you don't want to continue anymore. Burnout can be around for a long time._

## 3
Reward yourself - Managed to learn how to play C-chord on the guitar, that you always wanted to? Even if you practice for only 30 mins. __Go and reward yourself. Get a ice-cream!__ Moving out of the comfort zone is not easy. Being Discipline is not easy.   
Cross out the todo list, reward yourself with some endorphins.  

_Making yourself feels good, is the only way to last in the joruney. Exercising should make you feel alot better and energetic aftewards. Its scientifically proven. So always reward yourself. Play some game for example._

## 4
Making the Habits - Humans work effortlessly when a chore becomes a Habit. Remember that muscle memory? Talking about only the good habit here. Be amazed by how effective human can be when learning become part of a habit. Do some reading, learn some new stuff. Understand some gameplay strategy. Comes naturally when a habit is formed. 

_Most of us misunderstood what is a habit. They tend to relate it to personalities. Please try to look at them a - part. Habits are formed, if I always drink cold drink after a meal. Its a habit, its cultivated._

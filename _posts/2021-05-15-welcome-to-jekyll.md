Hi! This is my first blog post. I have been working on setting this up and hosting on github pages. <br />
In this blog, I will write about technical articles and blog on my perspective on life and different thought processes. <br />

Indeed this is to mark the initial of this blog. 
There are plenty of tutorial out there on hosting your own domain on github pages with Jekyll static framework. 

Just explore around and you are able to spin up a blog real fast. I managed to complete to this state in about 3 days or so and I have no clue on purchasing Domain, hosting, github pages, Jekyll. 

It can easily be abit too overwhelming! But do remember that everyone have to start off somewhere. 

Picking up new skills or going out of comfort zone are indeed tough and opposing of human nature. 
I have plans to write my take on "minimum criterion" to get started and on accelerating ability to learn and adapt along the way.
